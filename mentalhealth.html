<blockquote><b>Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</b> is an action-oriented approach to psychotherapy that stems from traditional behavior therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Clients learn to stop avoiding, denying, and struggling with their inner emotions and, instead, accept that these deeper feelings are appropriate responses to certain situations that should not prevent them from moving forward in their lives. With this understanding, clients begin to accept their hardships and commit to making necessary changes in their behavior, regardless of what is going on in their lives and how they feel about it. <br/><br/>

ACT was developed in the 1980s by psychologist Steven C. Hayes, a professor at the University of Nevada. The ideas that coalesced into ACT emerged from Hayes's own experience, particularly his history of panic attacks. Eventually, he vowed that he would no longer run from himself—he would accept himself and his experiences."<br/><br/>

<b>Nataly's Notes:</b> Acceptance, notably Radical Acceptance, has a long history of efficacy observed in many philosophies, most notably and prominently in Buddhism. This is demonstrated in the Buddha's parable of the second arrow.  </aside>
